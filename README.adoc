= Providing metrics from a microservice

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

You'll explore how to provide system and application metrics from a microservice with MicroProfile Metrics.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics from a microservice. You can monitor
metrics to determine the performance and health of a service. You can also use them to pinpoint issues,
collect data for capacity planning, or to decide when to scale a service to run with more or fewer
resources.

The application that you will work with is an `inventory` service that stores information about various
systems. The `inventory` service communicates with the `system` service on a particular host to retrieve
its system properties when necessary.

You will use annotations provided by MicroProfile Metrics to instrument the `inventory` service to
provide application-level metrics data. You will add counter, gauge, and timer metrics to the service.

You will also check well-known REST endpoints that are defined by MicroProfile Metrics to review
the metrics data collected. Monitoring agents can access these endpoints to collect metrics.

// Try what you'll build
// =================================================================================================

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory contains the finished implementation for the application. You can try it out
before you build your own.

To try the application, navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
-----------
mvn install liberty:start-server
-----------

Maven builds the application and runs it inside Open Liberty.

Point your browser to the http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^] URL to access the `inventory`
service. Because you just started the application, the inventory is currently empty. Then, access the
http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost^] URL to add the localhost into the inventory.

Access the `inventory` service at the http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^] URL at least once
for application metrics to be collected. Otherwise, the metrics will not appear.

Next, point your browser to the https://localhost:9443/metrics[http://localhost:9443/metrics^] MicroProfile Metrics endpoint. Log in
as the `admin` user with `adminpwd` as the password. You can see both the system and application
metrics in a text format.

To see only the application metrics, point your browser to https://localhost:9443/metrics/application[https://localhost:9443/metrics/application^].

See the following sample outputs for the `@Timed`, `@Gauge`, and `@Counted` metrics:

[role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_properties_request_time_rate_per_second gauge
application:inventory_properties_request_time_rate_per_second 0.012564862395324394
# HELP application:inventory_properties_request_time_seconds Time needed to get the properties of a system from the given hostname
----
[role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_size_guage gauge
# HELP application:inventory_size_guage Number of systems in the inventory
application:inventory_size_guage 1
----
[role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE application:inventory_access_count counter
# HELP application:inventory_access_count Number of times the list of systems method is requested
application:inventory_access_count 1
----

To see only the system metrics, point your browser to https://localhost:9443/metrics/base[https://localhost:9443/metrics/base^].

See the following sample output for the `@Gauge` and `@Counted` metrics:

[role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE base:jvm_uptime_seconds gauge
# HELP base:jvm_uptime_seconds Displays the start time of the Java virtual machine in milliseconds. This attribute displays the approximate time when the Java virtual machine started.
base:jvm_uptime_seconds 39.025
----
[role="no_copy"]
----
# TYPE base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count counter
# HELP base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count Displays the number of classes that are currently loaded in the Java virtual machine.
base:classloader_current_loaded_class_count 9144
----

When you're done with the application, stop the Open Liberty server with the following command:

[role=command]
----
mvn liberty:stop-server

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The MicroProfile Metrics API was added as a dependency to your [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` file. This is the dependency with
the [hotspot=mpMetrics file=0]`mpMetrics` artifact ID. This dependency was added to use the MicroProfile Metrics API
in your code to provide metrics from your microservices.

#Create the server configuration file.#
`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`

The [hotspot=mpMetrics file=1]`mpMetrics` feature enables MicroProfile Metrics support in Open Liberty. Note that this
feature requires SSL and the configuration has been provided for you.

The [hotspot=quickStartSecurity file=1]`quickStartSecurity` and [hotspot=keyStore file=1]`keyStore` configuration elements provide basic security to secure the
server. When you visit the `/metrics` endpoint, use the credentials defined in the server
configuration to log in to view the data.

Apply the [hotspot=Timed]`@Timed` annotation to the [hotspot=get]`get()` method to track how frequently the method is
invoked and also how long it takes for the invocation to complete. This annotation has these
metadata fields:

|===
|[hotspot=name]`name` | Optional. Use this field to name of the metric.
|[hotspot=absolute]`absolute` | Optional. Use this field to determine whether the metric name is the exact name that is specified in the [hotspot=name]`name` field or that is specified with the package prefix.
|[hotspot=description]`description` | Optional. Use this field to describe the purpose of the metric.
|===

Apply the [hotspot=Counted]`@Counted` annotation to the [hotspot=list]`list()` method to count how many times the
http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^] URL is accessed. 

Apply the [hotspot=Gauge]`@Gauge` annotation to the [hotspot=getTotal]`getTotal()` method to track the number of systems that are stored in
the inventory. Note that when the value of the gauge is retrieved, the underlying [hotspot=getTotal]`getTotal()` method
is called to return the size of the inventory. Note the additional metadata field:

|===
| [hotspot=unit]`unit` | Set the unit of the metric. If it is [hotspot=unit]`MetricUnits.NONE`, the metric name is used as is without appending the unit name, and no scaling is applied.
|===

Additional information about these annotations, relevant metadata fields, and more are available at
the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics[MicroProfile website^].

Point your browser to the https://localhost:9443/metrics[https://localhost:9443/metrics^] URL to review the all available metrics
that have been enabled through MicroProfile Metrics. Log in with `admin` as your username and
`adminpwd` as your password. You see only the system metrics because the server just started,
and the `inventory` service has not been accessed.

Next, point your browser to the http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^] URL. Reload the
https://localhost:9443/metrics[https://localhost:9443/metrics^] URL, or access only the application metrics at the
https://localhost:9443/metrics/application[https://localhost:9443/metrics/application^] URL.

You can test your application manually, but automated tests ensure code quality because they trigger a
failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple
environment for you to write tests.

* The [hotspot=testPropertiesRequestTimeMetric file=0]`testPropertiesRequestTimeMetric()` test case validates the [hotspot=Timed file=1]`@Timed` metric. It sends a request to the
`\http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost` URL to access the `inventory` service, which adds
the `localhost` host to the inventory. Next, the test case makes a connection to the
`\https://localhost:9443/metrics/application` URL to retrieve application metrics as plain text.
Then, it asserts whether the time that is needed to retrieve
the system properties for localhost is less than 4 seconds.

* The [hotspot=testInventoryAccessCountMetric file=0]`testInventoryAccessCountMetric()` test case validates the [hotspot=Counted file=1]`@Counted` metric. The test case sends a request to the
`\http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` URL to retrieve the whole inventory, and then it asserts
that this endpoint is accessed only once.

* The [hotspot=testInventorySizeGaugeMetric file=0]`testInventorySizeGaugeMetric()` test case validates the [hotspot=Gauge file=1]`@Gauge` metric. The test case first ensures
that the localhost is in the inventory. It then looks for the [hotspot=Gauge file=1]`@Gauge` metric and asserts
that the inventory size is equal to 1.

The [hotspot=oneTimeSetup file=0]`oneTimeSetup()` method retrieves the port number for the server and builds a base URL string
to set up the tests. Apply the [hotspot=BeforeClass file=0]`@BeforeClass` annotation to this method to execute it before any of
the test cases.

The [hotspot=setup]`setup()` method creates a JAX-RS client that makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service.
Register this client with a [hotspot=JsrJsonpProvider file=0]`JsrJsonpProvider` JSON-P provider to process JSON resources. The
[hotspot=teardown]`teardown()` method destroys this client instance. Apply the [hotspot=Before file=0]`@Before` annotation so that a method
executes before a test case, and apply the [hotspot=After file=0]`@After` annotation so that a method executes after a test
case. Apply these annotations to methods that are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks
before and after a test.

To execute the test cases in a particular order, put them in a [hotspot=testSuite file=0]`testSuite()` method.
Label the method with the [hotspot=Test]`@Test` annotation, which automatically executes when your test class runs.

In addition, a few endpoint tests `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointTest.java`
and `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointTest.java` are provided for you to
test the basic functionality of the `inventory` and `system` services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have
introduced a bug into the code.
